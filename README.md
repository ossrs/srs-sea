# SRS-SEA

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This repository is deprecated and archived, please use [srs-rn](https://github.com/ossrs/srs-rn) instead. srs-rn is the future of client project for SRS and Oryx.

Recommand to use [YASEA](https://github.com/begeekmyfriend/yasea),
because SEA is just a demo of encoder for Android.

For users who want to get SEA code, please checkout to branch
[feature/deprecated](https://github.com/ossrs/srs-sea/tree/feature/deprecated).
